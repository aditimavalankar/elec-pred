Steps to generate results:

1.  Run All_graphs.ipynb
2.  You will see all the generated pickle files in the Results/Pickles directory. These will be used in subsequent notebooks. You will also see two graphs generated in the Results/Graphs directory.
3.  Run Predictive_Task_1.ipynb to see the accuracies of the first three models.
4.  Run Predictive_Task_2.ipynb to see the accuracies of Models 4 and 5.
5.  Run Latent Factor Model - Surprise.ipynb to see the RMSE of the latent factor model with and without timestamps.
6.  Run Similarities between members.ipynb
7.  You will see the generated graphs in the Results/Graphs directory. These correspond to the Jaccard and cosine similarities between any two members based on their interactions, keywords used, and timestamps.
